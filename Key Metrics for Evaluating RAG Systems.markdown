## 1. Faithfulness

### What It Means
Faithfulness measures whether the generated answer is **grounded in the retrieved documents** and not hallucinated (i.e., fabricated by the model without evidence).

### Why It’s Important
- Ensures answers are **accurate** and based on source data (e.g., PDFs, articles).
- Prevents misleading or false information, which can erode user trust.
- Critical for applications requiring factual accuracy, such as enterprise search or customer support.

### Example
- **Scenario**: A user asks about the creator of Azure AI Foundry.
  - **Document**: “Azure AI Foundry is built by Microsoft.”
  - **Answer**: “It’s built by Google.”
  - **Result**: Low faithfulness, as the answer contradicts the source document.
- **Tokenization Note**:
  - Documents and answers are tokenized (e.g., 8192-token limit for `gpt-4`).
  - Large documents are chunked (e.g., 500 tokens with 50-token overlap) to ensure all relevant content is processed without truncation.

---

## 2. Answer Relevancy

### What It Means
Answer relevancy evaluates whether the generated answer **directly addresses the user’s question**, even if it is faithful to the retrieved documents.

### Why It’s Important
- A faithful answer may still be **irrelevant** if it doesn’t fully respond to the query.
- Ensures the system provides **useful and focused** responses, improving user experience.
- Critical for question-answering systems where precision in addressing intent is key.

### Example
- **Scenario**: User asks, “What is Azure AI Foundry used for?”
  - **Document**: “Azure AI Foundry is a tool by Microsoft for building AI solutions.”
  - **Answer**: “Azure AI Foundry is a tool by Microsoft.”
  - **Result**: Faithful but low relevancy, as it doesn’t explain the **usage** (e.g., building AI solutions).
- **Tokenization Note**:
  - Queries and answers are tokenized to fit model limits (e.g., 8192 tokens for `gpt-4`).
  - Irrelevant answers may result from poor chunking; overlap (e.g., 50 tokens) helps retain context.

## 3. Context Precision

### What It Means
Context precision assesses whether the **retrieved documents** are directly relevant to the user’s question, minimizing unrelated or noisy content.

### Why It’s Important
- **Reduces noise** in retrieved documents, ensuring the model focuses on pertinent information.
- Improves answer quality by providing **relevant context** for generation.
- Essential for efficient RAG systems, especially with large knowledge bases.

### Example
- **Scenario**: User asks about “Azure AI Foundry features.”
  - **Retrieved Documents**:
    - Relevant: “Azure AI Foundry supports model fine-tuning and vector search.”
    - Irrelevant: “Power BI pricing starts at $10/month.”
  - **Result**: Low context precision due to unrelated documents about Power BI.
- **Tokenization Note**:
  - Retrieved documents are tokenized for embedding (e.g., 8192 tokens for `ada-002`).
  - Chunking with overlap (e.g., 10–20% of chunk size) ensures relevant sections are not split incorrectly.

---

## 4. Context Recall

### What It Means
Context recall measures whether the system retrieves **all necessary documents** to fully answer the question, ensuring no critical information is missed.

### Why It’s Important
- Missing key documents leads to **incomplete or incorrect answers**.
- Ensures **comprehensive coverage** of relevant information for accurate responses.
- Vital for knowledge-intensive tasks where all aspects of a topic must be addressed.

### Example
- **Scenario**: User asks, “What are all the features of Azure AI Foundry?”
  - **Available Documents**:
    - Document 1: “Azure AI Foundry supports model fine-tuning.”
    - Document 2: “It includes vector search and OCR capabilities.”
  - **Retrieved**: Only Document 1.
  - **Result**: Low context recall, as Document 2 (with additional features) was not retrieved, leading to an incomplete answer.
- **Tokenization Note**:
  - Missing documents may result from token limits (e.g., 8192 for `gpt-4`).
  - Proper chunking and indexing (e.g., 500-token chunks with 50-token overlap) ensure all relevant content is retrievable.

## 5. Additional Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics complement the core RAG evaluation metrics, providing deeper insights into model performance, fairness, and safety.

### 5.1 Perplexity
#### What It Means
Perplexity measures how well a model **predicts the next token** in a sequence, indicating the model's confidence in its output. Lower perplexity suggests better fluency and coherence.

#### Why It’s Important
- Assesses the **language quality** of generated text.
- Helps identify if the model struggles with certain contexts or generates incoherent responses.
- Useful for evaluating generative performance in RAG systems.

#### Example
- **Scenario**: A RAG system generates a response about Azure AI Foundry.
  - **Response**: “Azure AI Foundry is a Microsoft tool for AI development.”
  - **Perplexity**: Low if the model confidently predicts tokens based on retrieved documents; high if the response is erratic or off-topic.
- **Tokenization Note**: Perplexity is calculated over tokenized sequences (e.g., BPE for `gpt-4`), with lower scores for well-structured outputs.

### 5.2 BLEU Score
#### What It Means
BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) Score measures the **overlap of n-grams** between the generated text and a reference text, commonly used for translation or text generation tasks.

#### Why It’s Important
- Evaluates the **accuracy of generated text** compared to expected outputs.
- Useful for RAG systems generating structured responses (e.g., translations, answers).
- Higher BLEU scores indicate better alignment with reference texts.

#### Example
- **Scenario**: Translating “Azure AI Foundry is powerful” to French.
  - **Reference**: “Azure AI Foundry est puissant.”
  - **Generated**: “Azure AI Foundry est fort.”
  - **Result**: Moderate BLEU score due to partial n-gram overlap (e.g., “Azure AI Foundry” matches, but “puissant” vs. “fort” differs).
- **Tokenization Note**: BLEU relies on tokenized n-grams, requiring consistent tokenization (e.g., WordPiece) for reference and generated texts.

### 5.3 ROUGE Score
#### What It Means
ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measures **n-gram overlap** between generated text and reference text, primarily for summarization tasks.

#### Why It’s Important
- Assesses the **quality of summaries** generated by RAG systems.
- Focuses on recall (capturing key content) and precision (avoiding irrelevant content).
- Essential for tasks like summarizing retrieved documents.

#### Example
- **Scenario**: Summarizing a document about Azure AI Foundry.
  - **Reference**: “Azure AI Foundry supports model fine-tuning, vector search, and OCR.”
  - **Generated**: “Azure AI Foundry enables fine-tuning and vector search.”
  - **Result**: High ROUGE score for recall (captures most key terms) but lower for precision (misses OCR).
- **Tokenization Note**: ROUGE uses tokenized n-grams, with chunking for long documents to fit model limits (e.g., 8192 tokens).

### 5.4 BERTScore
#### What It Means
BERTScore measures **semantic similarity** between generated and reference texts using contextual embeddings from models like BERT.

#### Why It’s Important
- Captures **meaning-based similarity** beyond exact word matches, unlike BLEU or ROUGE.
- Ideal for evaluating RAG responses where semantic accuracy is critical.
- Higher BERTScore indicates closer semantic alignment.

#### Example
- **Scenario**: User asks, “What does Azure AI Foundry do?”
  - **Reference**: “Azure AI Foundry builds AI solutions with fine-tuning and search.”
  - **Generated**: “Azure AI Foundry creates AI tools with model training and search.”
  - **Result**: High BERTScore due to semantic similarity, despite different wording.
- **Tokenization Note**: Uses BERT’s tokenizer (e.g., WordPiece, 512-token limit), requiring chunking for longer texts.

### 5.5 Hallucination Detection
#### What It Means
Hallucination detection identifies **fabricated or unsupported information** in generated responses, ensuring they align with retrieved documents.

#### Why It’s Important
- Complements **Faithfulness** by explicitly flagging hallucinated content.
- Critical for maintaining trust in RAG systems, especially in sensitive domains (e.g., legal, medical).
- Enhances fact-checking capabilities.

#### Example
- **Scenario**: User asks about Azure AI Foundry’s features.
  - **Document**: “Supports fine-tuning and vector search.”
  - **Generated**: “Includes quantum computing capabilities.”
  - **Result**: Hallucination detected, as quantum computing is not mentioned in the document.
- **Tokenization Note**: Detection compares tokenized responses to document tokens, using overlap analysis to identify unsupported claims.

### 5.6 Bias Assessment
#### What It Means
Bias assessment evaluates whether generated responses exhibit **fairness across demographics** (e.g., gender, race) or contain biased language.

#### Why It’s Important
- Ensures **ethical outputs** free from discriminatory or unfair content.
- Critical for inclusive AI applications, especially in customer-facing systems.
- Aligns with Azure AI Content Safety standards.

#### Example
- **Scenario**: User asks, “Who uses Azure AI Foundry?”
  - **Document**: “Used by developers and businesses.”
  - **Generated**: “Primarily used by male engineers.”
  - **Result**: Bias detected due to unwarranted gender assumption.
- **Tokenization Note**: Bias detection analyzes tokenized text for biased terms, often using predefined lexicons or NLP models.

### 5.7 Safety
#### What It Means
Safety evaluation detects **harmful content** (e.g., violence, hate speech) in generated responses, ensuring compliance with ethical guidelines.

#### Why It’s Important
- Prevents **harmful or inappropriate outputs**, protecting users and organizations.
- Aligns with Azure AI Content Safety’s harm categories (e.g., Hate, Violence, Sexual).
- Essential for public-facing RAG systems.

#### Example
- **Scenario**: User asks about Azure AI Foundry.
  - **Generated**: “Azure AI Foundry is great, but avoid it due to security risks.”
  - **Result**: Safety concern flagged due to unsupported negative claim.
- **Tokenization Note**: Safety checks tokenize text (e.g., 1000-token limit for Azure AI Content Safety) to scan for harmful terms.

### 5.8 Robustness
#### What It Means
Robustness evaluates the system’s **performance under adversarial inputs** (e.g., ambiguous queries, typos, or malicious prompts).

#### Why It’s Important
- Ensures the RAG system remains **reliable** under challenging conditions.
- Critical for real-world applications where users may input varied or erroneous queries.
- Enhances system resilience and user trust.

#### Example
- **Scenario**: User asks, “Azur AI Foundy featurs?” (with typos).
  - **Expected**: System corrects typos and retrieves documents about Azure AI Foundry features.
  - **Result**: High robustness if the system handles the query correctly; low if it fails.
- **Tokenization Note**: Robustness tests include tokenized adversarial inputs, ensuring the system processes them within model limits (e.g., 8192 tokens).
